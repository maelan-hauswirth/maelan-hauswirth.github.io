The Soil Innovation Lab collaborates on research of soil from all around the world to better understand the health and function of soils.\n\nI am working on a large project researching how grazing management impacts soil health and soil carbon sequestration on rangeland and pastures. The project is called the Metrics, Management, & Monitoring (3M) project and is being led by Colorado State University, Noble Research Institute, and Michigan State University with other collaborators across the United States as well as in the United Kingdom.\n\nAssist on a rangeland/ pasture soil health and carbon sequestration study by processing thousands of soil samples, including sieving and biogeochemical tests\nAccurately record data on spreadsheets and entering data into Excel spreadsheets\nCoordinating and managing a large team of fellow lab assistant to keep a large research project running efficiently and smoothly\nMaintaining a clean and organized lab space\nTraining 2-8 lab assistants on proper laboratory protocols and procedures\nAssist with troubleshooting and coming up with practical solutions\n\n\n\nFor more information, visit this website: https://www.noble.org/research/3m/\n\n\n\n\n\n3M Project Cover\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoil Sampling in Wyoming with Dr. Francesca Cotrufo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransplanting Seedlings to put in a Carbon Isotope Labeling Chamber\n\n\n\n\nColorado State University San Luis Valley Research Center\nGrazing Management Intern\nCenter, CO\nMay 2023- August 2023\n\nI interned at the CSU San Luis Valley Research Center on a grazing management project during the summer of 2023. The San Luis Valley is a high altitude region in southern Colorado that specializes in agriculture, but faces a limited water supply. Because of this, farmers in the valley are exploring different ways they can use their land when it’s not planted with cash crops. Integrating livestock onto cropland not actively growing cash crops is a practice being proposed, but comes with challenges producers normally specialize in either farming or ranching. I helped conduct a study on high density, rotational grazing with a small herd of goats to see if this form of management is economically and environmentally sustainable as well as practical to implement. I also worked with the director of the local CSU Extension, Larry Brown, to help create a way for producers to exchange goods and services, such as grazing land and animals that need land to graze on.\n\nInterned with the San Luis Valley Research Center and Extension office to conduct a high density rotational grazing study\nManaged a small herd of goats, including daily rotations of their pen, proper husbandry, medical care, and nutrition\nConducted and economic analysis to compare cost of forage and supplies to the benefits gained from high density rotational grazing\nCollaborated with the local CSU Extension director to communicate with local producers to create a network/ list in order to connect producers who want to exchange goods and/ or services\nAssisted with daily farm management tasks, such as operating a forklift, weeding fields, planting research plots, turn irrigation on and off, collect potato pollen for the breeding research team, and rogue diseased potato plants\nCreated a research poster to present my experience and results with stakeholders from Colorado State University and other companies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo of the goats in my herd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlowering potato plants. The CSU SLVRC is also a potato breeding farm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree calfs on the farm\n\n\n\n\nThis is the poster I created to summarize my internship experience at the research center:\n\n\n\nI conducted this research with help from Zach Czarnecki, Jeff Davidson, Larry Brown, and Dr. Megan Machmuller\n\n\nCambridge Animal Hospital\nVeterinary Technician Assistant\nLongmont, CO\nJune 2020- May 2022\n\nI worked at a domestic (dog and cat only) veterinary hospital that had a high flow of surgeries and patient appointments.\n\nAssisted other vet techs and veterinarians with performing medical procedures and prepare samples to effectively keep a faced paced hospital running smoothly and safely\nSterilized, wrapped, and sorted surgical instruments, cleaned cages, and exam rooms in order to keep a sanitary and organized hospital\nTalked with owners and assisted with taking care of patients staying in the hospital\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBroomfield Veterinary Hospital\nKennel Technician\nBroomfield, CO\nMay 2017- May 2021\n\nI worked at an exotic (cats, dogs, rabbits, birds, reptiles, amphibians, etc.) veterinary hospital that had many surgeries and clients on a daily basis. I helped lead a small team of other kennel technicians clean and stock the hospital.\n\nStocked medical supplies, cleaned cages and the clinic\nAssisted veterinarian technicians and vets with holding rabbits for medical procedures\nTook care of client’s birds being boarded in the hospital\nCentrifuged blood samples and made sure all samples got sent to the lab\nCleaned and sanitized medical instruments\nLed a team of other kennel technicians in order to keep an efficient and well organized team that kept the clinic clean and running smoothly\nTrained new kennel technicians on proper procedure and cleaning protocol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRocky Mountain House Rabbit Rescue\nVolunteer, member of the medical team\nBroomfield, CO\nJuly 2011- February 2022\n\nRocky Mountain House Rabbit Rescue, formerly known as Colorado House Rabbit Society, is a shelter in Colorado dedicated exclusively to rescuing and rehabbing house rabbits. I volunteered at the shelter for 11 years doing any and all tasks needing to be done at the shelter.\n\nCleaned rabbit cages,\nFed and groomed rabbits\nProvided medical care to rabbits\n\nadminister eye drops, fluids, injections, oral medications, etc.\n\nWork closely with other volunteers, supervisors, and directors to help keep the rabbits healthy and happy\nEducate visitors and assist during events at the shelter"

During my time at CSU I will be networking with professionals and attending conferences to gain more knowledge about the field of sustainability, agriculture, and greenhouse gas management.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am interested in working in industry, academia, government, or non-profit sectors​.\nI enjoy working on large projects​ with many moving parts that have the potential to make an impact on people and the environment.\nI am interested in nature-based climate solutions​ because I believe that we can work with nature, instead of against it, in order to make a better world for people and the environment.\nI enjoy collaborating with multiple disciplines such as engineering, social science, environmental science, etc.\nI hope to get a job where I can be on a team that works on sustainability. I know I enjoy working on projects that have many moving parts so that I can have multiple responsibilities. I also enjoy working with people and being in a role where I can help organize projects and help team members. \nAfter learning about agrivoltaics and volunteering a day at an agrivoltaic farm, I have a growing interest in these operations.\n\nAgrivoltaics is the practice of combining agriculture with generating energy with solar panels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany different plants and crops growing between solar panels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSheep on the farm graze underneath the solar panels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolar panels on the farm can tilt to capture sunlight as the sun moves"
